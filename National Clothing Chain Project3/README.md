# Project Overview ðŸ‘•ðŸ‘œ
The project, titled "Market Analysis Report for National Clothing Chain," aims to assist an online clothing retailer in developing a targeted marketing campaign to boost stagnant sales and re-engage lost customers. The chain wants to advertise three specific productsâ€”shirts ($25), sweaters ($100), and leather bags ($1,000)â€”but lacks clarity on which customers to target. Your task is to conduct an analysis to identify the most suitable product for each customer based on their preferences and locations.
