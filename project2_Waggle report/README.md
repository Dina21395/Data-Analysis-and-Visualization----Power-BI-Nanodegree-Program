# Project Overview
Imagine yourself as a business intelligence analyst at Waggle, an innovative company that creates smart devices for pets. You are tasked with evaluating the potential for a cat version of the successful Lapdog fitness collar. After receiving positive feedback on the Lapdog, Waggle distributed 1,000 Lapcat prototypes for testing. Your job is to create a Power BI report that compares the Lapcat data to findings from the Lapdog, aiming to either convince the CEO that the Lapcat is the next big thing or highlight it as a costly mistake to be avoided. This report will focus on whether cats using the device have similar average daily steps and how satisfied Lapcat owners are compared to Lapdog owners. The CEO wants clear answers to these questions, while the Chief Marketing Officer requests that the report follows Waggleâ€™s branding guidelines. The product team is also interested in demographic comparisons and interactive features for deeper analysis. Using the provided data model and branding materials, your report will include at least seven visualizations, a well-structured layout, easy navigation buttons, and several slicers to help users explore the data effectively.
